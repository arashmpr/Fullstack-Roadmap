# Roadmaps

I am suffering from not having enough technical knowledge and I want to start being a better programmer here.
We'll start by learning HTML as the roadmap says

## HTML

According to the guy on youtube we have 3 main sections for layouting the page:
- Header section
- Main Section: Meat and the bone section where all the content is there.
- Footer section: it's at the end, maybe social media pages or things like that.

## Projects

### Netflix
In this project, we created the homepage of netflix from scratch using css and html.
